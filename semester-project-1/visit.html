        <h1>Welcome to the Community Science Museum</h1>
        <p>Come join us at the Community Science Museum where we’re committed to making science
        accessible to all. Over the course of human history, science has developed from our early 
        understanding of fire, wind, water, and earth to exploring everything from galaxies far away to
        the very building blocks of life itself.
        The aim of our museum is to create a space where everyone can experience the wonders of
        our discoveries and perhaps even ignite a lifelong passion to continue the exploration of the 
        world around us. We believe science should not be confined to the textbook, but brought to 
        live through exhibits. This is why we have over 1000 different exhibits on the many varied 
        subjects of science to explore. Many of these exhibits are designed for you to interact with
        and play around to see science come to life (apart from the dinosaur exhibits 
        – they only come to life at night when everyone’s gone home).
