          <h2>Cosmology</h2>
          <p>Explore the wonders of our cosmos. Our fantastic exhibition, ‘The Sky Above Us’, explores the 
          night sky and what we can see and know about the universe around us. We’ll locate the various
          constellations and galaxies that can be seen and learn a bit about the early navigators who used
          the stars to travel by. Follow the journey of our solar exploration: from early Arab traders, 
          to Galileo’s telescope, to the latest exploration of the planets in our solar system.

          <h2>Biology and Medicine</h2>
          <p>From micro-organisms to the human body, major breakthroughs in biology are offering us unique
          insights into the great wonders of the tiny world. For many people their life expectancy is much
          longer and their quality of life much improved, thanks to the growth of our understanding of
          medicine. Over a series of exhibits we explore the history of medicine and take a look at some
          major breakthroughs including the discovery of penicillin and the first heart transplant. Many of
          our great medicinal discoveries have come not only from the lab, but also from observing
          animals in the wild. Often our fellow creatures have beat us to it.

          <h3>Ecology</h3>
          <p>As we learn more and more of the impact humans are having
          on the planet, the more important it becomes that scientists
          explore how to create a sustainable future not just for humans
          but for the whole planet. In our ecology section of the museum,
          we unpack the dangers we currently face including global
          warming, extinction of species, and pollution. But we also focus
          on the positive ways we can all contribute to a brighter future.

          <h3>Evolution</h3>
          <p>For centuries, philosophers and scientists have wrestled
          with the question of our origins. Where do we come from 
          and how did we get here? Since Darwin proposed his
          theory of evolution we have had a framework for exploring
          and understanding our place in this world. Discover the
          origins of life on this planet and how the species we know
          today have evolved our time. You can also take some time
          to meet a few of the creatures who didn’t survive, including
          our Woolly Mammoth, the Dodos, and a number of
          dinosaurs too.

          <h3>Robotics and AI</h3>
          <p>The information revolution is here and robotics and artificial
          intelligence are the science of the future. From useful home
          applications of AI to industrial uses of robotics, the future is
          here. You can even say hello and shake the hand of
          Rob the Robot.
