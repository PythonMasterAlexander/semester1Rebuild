          <h2>Volunteer</h2>
          <p>A number of people volunteer their time and effort to keep the displays in good 
          order and ready for visitors to come and enjoy. Volunteering has its perks including 
          getting to see behind the scenes of a working museum, access to staff-only 
          lectures, and a monthly lunch where all staff and volunteers come together to 
          discuss ideas for future exhibits and strategies for the museum.
          You can help volunteer in a number of different spheres. Please contact us if you’d 
          like to find out more about how you can get involved.

          <p>Are you interested in working in a museum? Do you enjoy the fun and excitement of 
          sharing the wonders of nature with people? Well you could be just the right person to 
          enjoy an internship at the museum. You’ll be learning from a number of different 
          academics and people who are passionate about science and sharing it with the

          <h3>Visiting Professor of Aeronautics</h3>
          <p>It is our pleasure to announce that Prof Sheila Widnall from the 
          Massachusetts Institute of Technology will be delivering 3 lectures 
          on the development of aeronautics and where the future lies in 
          this exciting ‘space’.

          <h4>Energetica Exhibition on Loan</h4>
          <p>On loan from the NEMO Science Museum in Amsterdam, the Energetica exhibition is
          coming to the Community Science Museum. It’s a series of installations that allow 
          visitors to experience the power of the elements as we harness them. From solar 
          energy powering lighting, to ‘Wind Island’ that shows how turbines are able to use 
          and control wind to create power.

          <h4>Night in the Museum</h4>
          <p>Get your family together for an exciting night in the museum as you sleep over beside
          dinosaurs and science displays. Bring your own sleeping bag and get ready to rough it
          as we go exploring the wonders of science.
